# parity-mvc-intro

## Goal

The goal of this project is to determine your Model-View-Controller design patterns. The project should not take more than four to eight hours to complete.

## Deliverables

Using an MVC framework, build a simple registration model for students to register for courses at a college. Students should be able to use an online form to register themselves, and see a list of available courses to them. The deliverables should include a SQL database and associated tables (at the very least a table for students and a table for classes), and all the MVC code to successfully deploy the project.
